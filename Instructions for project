1.
First, import numpy and matplotlib.

2.
Look over the cereal.csv file. This file contains the reported calorie amounts for different cereal brands. Load the data from the file and save it as calorie_stats.

3.
There are 70 calories per serving of CrunchieMunchies. How much higher is the average calorie count of your competition? Save it to the variable average_calorie.

4.
Does the average adequately reflect the data distribution? Check by sorting the data and then print the results to the terminal.

5.
Do you see what I'm seeing? Looks like the majority of the cereals are higher than the mean.

Calculate the median and see if it's more representative of the dataset and save your answer to median_calorie.

6.
To really drive your point home, you should show that a significant portion of the data has a high-calorie count.

Calculate different percentiles until you find the lowest percentile that is more than 100 calories.

7.
Now, calculate the percentage of cereal in the dataset that has 100 or more calories. Save your answer to the variable high_calorie and print it to the terminal.

8.
So far, we've only been looking at specific values. But one question is, how similar are the different values to each other?

Calculate the variation by finding the standard deviation. Save you answer to calorie_std and print to the terminal.

9.
Write a short paragraph that sums up your findings and how you think this data could be used to Yummy Corp's advantage when marketing CrunchieMunchies.
